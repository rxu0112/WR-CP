We refer to Section 6.1 and Appendix D.1 for a detailed introduction to datasets and sampling procedures. Files in `data\name\processed` can be used to reproduce experiment results.
You can also run codes in `data_prepare` to resample new training, calibration, and test sets. The raw data in `data\seattle\raw` should be unzipped before resampling.
