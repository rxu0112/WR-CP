`WRCP_main.py` and `CQR_main.py` can be run for each dataset and each trial to reproduce the results in the `main_result` folder.
With all experiment results in the `main_result` folder, `plot_W_distance_main.py`, `plot_main_result.py`, and `plot_ablation.py` generates Figure 3, 4, 5, respectively.
